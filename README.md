# ICE-Assignment1

This repository contains my work for ICE Assignment 1, where I applied the Engineering Method to design and evaluate a Railway Crossing System.
The system is designed to prevent accidents at road–rail intersections by automatically lowering gates, activating warning lights, and sounding alarms when a train approaches.

The repository also demonstrates the use of GitHub for professional project documentation and version control.

- How to View Files

Click on each folder to open the PDF, Word doc, or image.
Flowcharts are saved in both PNG and PDF formats for readability.
Tables (algorithm, testing, refinements) are saved as PDFs for easy submission.


- Features of the System

Fail-safe design → If a fault or emergency is detected, gate closes with lights and alarm ON.
Pre-warning delay → 5–7 seconds warning before gate lowers, allowing cars to clear.
Vehicle check → Prevents trapping a car on the tracks.
Testing and refinement → At least four test cases documented, with refinements suggested (e.g., debounce logic, configurable timing).


- Stakeholders in the Project

Train operators
Vehicle drivers and pedestrians
Local community
Railway authorities
Government regulators
